The streets of your city smell of vada pav, hope and a lover's embrace.
Gravel on roads still moist from an untimely skyfall last night,
I step with a cautious umbrella into the train,
Rumbles of a heartbroken rain showers down screaming to be heard,
Throwing tantrums that shred the sky,
I ignore it, because it has to die out, right?
(No one lives in agony forever)
